    <p>How you doin' fellas?! I'm so happy to be your peer this course. I'm 24 years old, I'm single and I'm working part-time as an uber driver here in the Metro Area of my country's main city, Asunci√≥n.</p>
    <p>I've been born and raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, my great-grandmother was among the pioneer members of the church here in my country, Paraguay. Thanks to my family, I have serve as a full-time missionary in the Argentina Buenos Aires West Mission, an experience that gave me a huge love for the Argentinian people, and drowned me in massive happiness when Messi finally hold the World Cup last month.</p>
    <p>My dream job is to become a full-stack developer, that's why I choose the Web and Computer programming major, and BYU-I is a blessing in my life for providing these learning opportunities and a wonderful community.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my page. I hope to be a helping hand for any who need it and see you later amigos. Stay positive.</p>
